# Bandit Helper

# ###Introduction###

This tool had been made to make easier the conection by ssh to the bandit servers, the Tool have a log where all the passwords are stored, so be carfuly with which passwd do you introduce.

I recomend to use this tool on a gnome terminal, because it launches a gnome terminal and in my case (in bspwm) if i copy the passwd of the gnome terminal and i close it, i can't paste it on my kitty (where i have the tool runing).

Mybe in the future i'll make it to detect the shell and run it in that shell, but for now that's all
